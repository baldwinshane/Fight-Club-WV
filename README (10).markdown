# Fight Club WV API and Community

Welcome to the **Fight Club WV** project, a platform for organizing and managing an underground mixed martial arts (MMA) and bare knuckle fighting community in West Virginia (WV). This repository hosts a static site on GitHub Pages, providing access to a robust Fight Club API, a fighter application form, and links to rules and safety requirements. A separate Matrix protocol-based social media platform, hosted in its own repository, enables secure, encrypted group communication for Fight Club members. The project emphasizes privacy, safety, and competitive integrity, adhering to the core principle: *Fight Club is not to be spoken of out loud*.

## Overview
The Fight Club WV project creates a secure, community-driven platform for organizing underground fights, managing fighter data, and fostering communication while maintaining strict privacy protocols. The GitHub Pages static site serves as the central hub for:
- A **Fight Club API** to manage fighter profiles, leaderboards, winnings, fight cards, and streaks.
- A **Google Forms-based fighter application** for new members to apply.
- A link to a separate repository detailing **rules and health requirements**, including mandatory physicals, mouth guards, and hand wraps, with options for MMA gloves or bare knuckle leagues.

A separate repository, [Fight Club WV Matrix Social](https://github.com/username/fight-club-wv-matrix-social), hosts a **Matrix protocol-based social media platform** for secure, encrypted group communication, replacing the previously integrated Matrix chat. This platform functions as a private social media network for Fight Club members, ensuring anonymity and security.

The project enforces Fight Club's ethos: intelligent individuals participate, but discretion is paramount. Violations, such as posting on external social media (e.g., Facebook), result in a permanent ban.

## API Features
The Fight Club WV API is a RESTful service designed to support a wide range of functionalities for managing the Fight Club ecosystem. Below are the core features, followed by potential enhancements:

## Fighter Application
New fighters can apply to join Fight Club WV via a **Google Forms application** accessible on the GitHub Pages static site at `/apply`. The form collects:
- Personal details (name, contact info, alias).
- Fighting experience and style (e.g., boxing, BJJ, Muay Thai).
- Weight class and physical stats.
- Confirmation of health check submission.
- Acknowledgment of Fight Club rules.

Applicants must submit proof of a recent physical examination confirming they are free of communicable diseases.

## Rules and Safety Requirements
A separate repository, [Fight Club WV Rules](https://github.com/username/fight-club-wv-rules), details the rules and safety protocols:
- **Mandatory Safety Gear**:
  - **Mouth Guard**: Required for all fights to protect teeth and reduce concussion risk.
  - **Hand Wraps**: Mandatory to protect wrists and knuckles.
  - **MMA Gloves League**: Optional league using 4-6 oz MMA gloves for added protection and grappling flexibility.
  - **Bare Knuckle League**: Optional league for traditional bare knuckle fighting, with increased risk of hand injuries.
- **Health Requirements**: All fighters must submit a physical examination confirming no communicable diseases (e.g., hepatitis, MRSA).
- **Sparring Rules**: Fighters may spar with others, but those who spar together are ineligible for leaderboard rankings to ensure opponents remain unpredictable.
- **Prohibited Actions**:
  - No video recordings of fights to maintain secrecy and ensure fighters learn their opponents' styles only during matches.
  - No external social media mentions (e.g., Facebook, Twitter). Violators will be permanently banned.
  - Illegal moves (e.g., groin strikes, head butting, eye gouging) are strictly prohibited.

## Matrix Social Media Platform
A standalone repository, [Fight Club WV Matrix Social](https://github.com/username/fight-club-wv-matrix-social), hosts a **Matrix protocol-based social media platform** for Fight Club members. This platform serves as a private, encrypted social network, separate from the GitHub Pages static site, with the following features:
- End-to-end encrypted group chats for event planning, sparring coordination, and community discussions.
- Anonymous user handles to protect identities.
- Channels for specific topics (e.g., fight announcements, training tips).
- Integration with the Fight Club API for notifications (e.g., fight card updates, leaderboard changes).
- Support for private messaging and group rooms.
- Moderation tools to enforce Fight Club rules (e.g., banning users for external social media posts).

The Matrix social platform is accessible via a dedicated URL (e.g., `https://matrix.fightclubwv.org`) and uses the Matrix protocol to ensure privacy and security.

## Leaderboard and Fight Data
The Fight Club WV API powers a leaderboard and fight data section on the GitHub Pages static site:
- **Leaderboards**: Display top fighters based on wins, streaks, and performance metrics. Fighters who spar together are excluded to maintain competitive fairness.
- **Winnings**: Track and display earnings or rewards per fighter, updated after each event.
- **Fight Cards**: List upcoming fights with fighter details and weight classes.
- **Streaks**: Highlight consecutive wins or losses for each fighter.

Access these features at `/leaderboard` and `/fight-cards` on the static site.
